_This is a fork of @thecodemonkey's <a href="https://github.com/thecodemonkey/synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations">synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations</a>, which is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/webrender/synthwave-x-fluoromachine">synthwave-x-fluoromachine</a>, which is also fork of @robbowen's [Synthwave '84 theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode), merged with @fullerenedream's [Fluoromachine](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/FluoroMachine/) theme and @74th's [Monokai Charcoal high contrast](https://github.com/74th/vscode-monokaicharcoal) purple theme for VSCode._

## Why?

The job of a software developer is hard and often too serious. You always have to be productive and effective. But sometimes you need to take the time to just be a nerd ðŸ¤“ or to just have fun again. This theme is exactly for such times! Such nerdy times need to be celebrated accordingly ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¦„

## Installation

Unfortunately, the current installation is a bit complicated.
A hassle-free installation is already in development.
Until then, the following steps must be performed to install the theme:

1. Install this theme
2. Install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) VS Code extension
3. Link the CSS file from this extension in your VS Code settings.json:

```
On Mac it might look something like the snippet below:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/coltwillcox.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-2.0.0/logo.css",
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/coltwillcox.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-2.0.0/synthwave.css"
  ]
}

Windows might resemble:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/coltwillcox.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-2.0.0/logo.css",
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/coltwillcox.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-2.0.0/synthwave.css"
  ]
}

Low spec machines (or just to disable animations):
Instead of "synthwave.css" use "synthwave-lowspec.css"

```

4. `logo.css` is optional and changes VS Code logo.
5. From the command panel, select `Reload Custom CSS and JS`. You'll need to run this command every time vscode updates.
